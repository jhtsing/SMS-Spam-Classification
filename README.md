# SMS-Spam-Classification
Extracted data from a public set of SMS labeled messages collected from open sources on the Internet.   Implemented six spam classification algorithms on this data using Python Scikit-Learn and NumPy.   Evaluated the algorithms by constructing a confusion matrix for each algorithm on python.   Naive Bayes and RBF SVM were found to be the most efficient algorithms for SMS spam detection.
